# first pivot
## Thu Dec 28 19:42:59 GMT 2023

Today I discovered ecovadis, which is a company that does sustainability/ethics ratings of companies. They were founded a long time ago and have more employees than we could ever dream of so we need to fidn a way to offer something. We have pivoted from creating the dataset ourselves, to crowdsourcing the data like wikipedia, alongside existing plans to automatically collate and verfiy data. This will hopefully make our data morr transparent, accessible, and trustworthy.
