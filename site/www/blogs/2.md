# building the dataset
## 2023-12-17T19:26:49+00:00

boikot is currently at 125 commits and we are starting to build the dataset! the effort is split between creating company entries and automating the process, and thinking how (open source) AI could speed up the process. Today I was in tesco and heard an announcement over the loudspeakers about how they were making a tool available to help people find items that are more sustainably packaged so i think we're on the right track 🙏
