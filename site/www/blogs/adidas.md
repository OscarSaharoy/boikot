Adidas, the German sportswear giant, finds itself embroiled in controversy over its supplier practices and internal issues of racial discrimination. Revelations have shed light on the company's involvement with suppliers that subject their employees to conditions akin to sweatshops.

According to a [report by Oxfam](https://www.oxfam.org.au/explore/workers-rights/adidas), Adidas has been linked to suppliers accused of maintaining sweatshop-like conditions for workers. These conditions, often characterized by long hours, low wages, and poor working conditions, have raised concerns about ethical sourcing within the sportswear industry.

In addition to supplier issues, Adidas faced internal turmoil as its head of Human Resources resigned amidst accusations of inaction against racial discrimination within the company. This development comes as a stark reminder of the systemic challenges faced by multinational corporations in fostering inclusive and equitable workplaces ([source](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-adidas-race/adidas-human-resources-head-steps-down-after-race-row-idUSKBN241332?il=0)).

As consumers, it's essential to stay informed about the ethical practices of the brands we support. Transparency and accountability are crucial in holding companies like Adidas accountable for their actions and pushing for meaningful change in the industry.
